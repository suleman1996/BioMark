            "body": "PCR stands for ‘polymerase chain reaction’. It is a method that is used to detect and accurately identify genetic material from any organism. The COVID-19 PCR test is currently the preferred test for COVID-19 detection because of its speed, accuracy and success rate- hence is widely used as the testing method of choice for pre-departure travel, work and social responsibility purposes. It is considered the gold-standard (best-in-class) for detection of COVID-19.<br><br>Most COVID-19 PCR test results will be ready within a few hours. However we recommend that you ask the staff at your selected test center/clinic for a more precise time frame."

            "question": "2. What is Antigen testing?",
            "body": "An antigen test detects coronavirus proteins in the mouth and throat. It works by mixing the sample with a solution that unleashes specific viral proteins. However, it takes a shorter time to generate a result as compared to a PCR test. Antigen tests typically take 15-30mins to generate a result and are generally deemed to be less accurate than PCR tests."

            "question": "3. What is Serology testing?",
            "body": "Serology is also called the Antibody test that looks for the presence of antibodies. Antibodies are typically detected in the blood of people who are tested after infection and they show an immune response to the infection. It is important for detecting previous infections in people who had few or no symptoms."

          "item5": {
            "question": "5. How will the COVID-19 PCR test be performed?",
            "body": "The test will be performed at the desired clinic by a healthcare professional (Doctor/Nurse). The COVID-19 PCR test is conducted by using a swab to collect respiratory samples found in your nose and your throat. A swab is a soft tip on a long flexible stick that goes into your nose. The sample is collected then sealed and sent to the laboratory for testing."

For those with signs and symptoms prior to your clinic visit, kindly indicate it in your health declaration. A COVID-19 test can be used for anyone regardless of age.

You may also select the express PCR test to receive your results within about 6 hours.<br><br>For travellers taking COVID-19 PCR tests for pre-departure purposes, please note that you are responsible for checking that your appointment and testing window is in line with the destination country’s regulations.
